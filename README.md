This project outlines the development process for a Fynd extension that displays product listings for a company and its associated applications. By following this guide, you'll be able to set up the development environment, build the extension locally, and understand the testing procedures.

## Quick start
### Prerequisites
* You have installed globally [Node 16.X.X](https://docs.npmjs.com/) or above version.
* You have fdk-cli installed [install](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-cli)
* You have created a [partner account](https://partners.fynd.com).
* You have created a [development account](https://partners.fynd.com/help/docs/partners/testing-extension/development-acc#create-development-account) and [populated test data](https://partners.fynd.com/help/docs/partners/testing-extension/development-acc#populate-test-data) in it.

## Install Template Locally
To initialize your extension template locally, run the following command:
```shell
fdk extension init
```
Enter your preferred extension name and type, then select the `Node + React.js + SQLite` option.

## Local Development
To start local development, execute the following command:
```shell
fdk extension preview
```
This command will provide a partner’s panel URL where you can interact with your extension. For more information, please read this [guide](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-cli?tab=readme-ov-file#extension-commands).

## Build for production
Build the frontend using the following commands:

Using yarn:
```shell
cd frontend && yarn run build
```
Using npm:
```shell
cd frontend && npm run build
```

## Database Configuration

By default, this template uses an `SQLite` database to store session data. SQLite is sufficient for development purpose only, it may not be suitable for all production scenarios. The best database for your application depends on your data requirements and query patterns.

If your app requires a more robust database solution, you can easily extend the base storage class provided by the `fdk-extension-javascript` library to use a database of your choice for session data. Here are some databases that we support by default:

- SQLite
- Memory Storage
- Redis

Feel free to configure and run your preferred database on your server to meet your specific needs.

## Tech Stack
1. [fdk-client-javascript](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-client-javascript): This library contains all the methods to call Fynd platform APIs.
2. [fdk-extension-javascript](https://github.com/gofynd/fdk-extension-javascript): This library streamlines the setup of authentication for accessing Fynd Platform APIs. It also simplifies the process of subscribing to webhooks for receiving real-time notifications.
